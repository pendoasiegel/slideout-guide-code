# Simple Slideout Instructions #
The slideout is 3 guides tied together with a custom header and some Javascript. The CSS changes a regular lightbox into a page height sidebar with a dynamic scroll bar.
1. Create 3 guides, one for each tab.
2. The code block is the first building block on each guide.
3. Add the HTML, CSS, and JS to each building block.
4. Notes in the code tell you which changes to make to the code. They're minimal.
5. Everything below the code block, the actual content, is regular building blocks. Go nuts.
6. Deployed from a guide list in the RC or literally any way you want to launch a guide. It's a guide. It behaves like a guide. It's just tied to other guides and looks like one guide.
7. The minimize/maximize button is not regular guide functionality. It's magic. Also I think it inherits some native styling in the Pendo app and might look weird somewhere else.
